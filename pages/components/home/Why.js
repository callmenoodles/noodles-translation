        English is the most common language in todayâ€™s world. However, this does not mean you should overlook potential customers or clients who do not speak English (well)!  Moreover, people generally prefer their first language, and multinationals are growing in different countries where English is not the dominant language. Making sure everyone understands your business by <span className='text-primary font-semibold'>translating to different languages, will lead to more success!</span>
